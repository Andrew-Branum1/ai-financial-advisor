# AI Financial Advisor: A Deep Reinforcement Learning System for Personalized Investment Guidance

---

## Abstract

This report presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the AI Financial Advisor, an end-to-end system that leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL), advanced feature engineering, and large language models (LLMs) to provide personalized investment recommendations for first-time investors. The system is designed to bridge the gap between sophisticated quantitative finance and accessible, user-friendly financial advice. It supports both short-term and long-term investment horizons, with risk profiles ranging from conservative to aggressive. The RL models are trained and validated on a diverse universe of 20 global equities, using a rich set of technical indicators and robust evaluation protocols. The system includes a web-based user interface and generates plain-language investment reports using LLMs. Extensive backtesting, stress testing, and benchmark comparisons demonstrate the system's realism, robustness, and practical value. This report details the full pipeline, from data collection and feature engineering to RL environment design, model training, evaluation, and user-facing deployment, and discusses the scientific and practical contributions of the project.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Access to high-quality, personalized financial advice remains a challenge for novice investors. Traditional advisory services are often expensive, opaque, and not tailored to individual needs. The rise of machine learning, and in particular reinforcement learning, offers the potential to automate and democratize investment guidance. However, most RL-based trading systems are designed for expert users and lack interpretability, risk controls, and user-friendly interfaces. This project aims to address these gaps by developing an AI-powered financial advisor that combines state-of-the-art RL, advanced feature engineering, and LLM-powered explanations in a modular, extensible, and research-grade platform.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The core problem addressed is: How can we design an AI system that provides robust, interpretable, and personalized investment recommendations for first-time investors, while maintaining scientific rigor and practical usability?

### 1.3 Contributions

- A modular RL-based portfolio management system supporting multiple investment horizons and risk profiles.
- Integration of over 30 technical indicators and advanced feature engineering.
- Top-5 selection logic for interpretability and real-world constraints.
- Comprehensive evaluation: rolling backtests, stress tests, and benchmark comparisons.
- LLM-powered, plain-language investment reports.
- Open, extensible codebase with reproducibility and research best practices.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 RL in Finance

- RL has been applied to portfolio optimization (Moody et al., 1998; Jiang et al., 2017), asset allocation (Li et al., 2019), and algorithmic trading (Deng et al., 2016).
- PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) is a state-of-the-art policy gradient method, widely used for its stability and sample efficiency.
- Attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017) have improved RL agent performance in high-dimensional, multi-asset settings.

### 2.2 Technical Indicators and Feature Engineering

- Technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and ATR are standard in quantitative finance (Achelis, 2001).
- Feature engineering and normalization are critical for RL stability and generalization (Zhang et al., 2020).

### 2.3 LLMs in Finance

- LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini) have been used for financial text analysis, report generation, and explainable AI (Chen et al., 2023).
- This project integrates LLMs for user-facing, plain-language investment reports.

### 2.4 User-Facing AI Systems

- Robo-advisors (e.g., Betterment, Wealthfront) provide automated portfolio management but rarely use RL or LLMs for personalized advice.
- This project advances the state-of-the-art by combining RL, LLMs, and a user-friendly web interface.

## 3. Methods

### 3.1 Data Pipeline

#### 3.1.1 Data Collection

- Historical daily price and volume data for 20 global equities (see `config.py: AGENT_TICKERS`) are collected using Yahoo Finance APIs via `src/data_collector_enhanced.py`.
- Data is stored in a SQLite database (`data/market_data.db`) and processed as pandas DataFrames.

#### 3.1.2 Feature Engineering

- Over 30 features per asset, including:
  - Price-based: close, daily return, momentum, SMA/EMA, MACD, Bollinger Bands
  - Volatility: rolling volatility (5, 20 days), ATR, volatility ratio
  - Volume: average volume, OBV, MFI, volume/SMA ratio
  - Trend: trend strength, ADX, CCI, stochastics, Williams %R
- Features are normalized and aligned for RL environment input (see `src/utils.py`).

#### 3.1.3 Data Splits

- Training: 2010–2021
- Validation: 2022–2024 (holdout)
- Stress test windows: COVID crash (2020-0222 to 2020-25), 2022 bear market

### 3.2 RL Environment Design

#### 3.2.1 Action and Observation Spaces

- Action: Portfolio weights for 20 assets (continuous, sum to 1 after top-5 selection logic)
- Observation: Stacked features for all assets over a rolling window (30–60 days)

#### 3.2.2 Reward Function

- Parameterized by profile (see `config_short_term.py`, `config_long_term.py`):
  - Sharpe ratio, momentum, drawdown penalty, turnover penalty
  - Volatility targeting, minimum holding period, sector/asset concentration limits
- Reward = weighted sum of risk-adjusted return, penalties, and constraints

#### 3.2.3 Top-5 Selection Logic

- After the RL agent outputs weights, only the top 5 assets (by weight) are selected; others are set to zero, and the top 5 are re-normalized to sum to 1.
- Enforced in both short-term and long-term environments (`rl/portfolio_env_short_term.py`, `rl/portfolio_env_long_term.py`).
- Improves interpretability and mimics real-world portfolio construction.

### 3.3 Model Training

#### 3.3.1 Model Profiles

- Six models: short-term/long-term × conservative/moderate/aggressive
- Each profile has custom environment parameters (volatility target, holding period, turnover penalty, etc.)

#### 3.3.2 RL Algorithm

- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) via Stable-Baselines3 (`rl/custom_ppo.py`)
- Attention-based policy network (`rl/attention_policy.py`)
- Hyperparameter optimization with Optuna (20–30 trials per model)
- Final training: 200,000–500,000 timesteps per model

#### 3.3.3 Training Flow

1. Load profile-specific config
2. Load market data and features
3. Create RL environment
4. Run Optuna hyperparameter search
5. Train final model with best hyperparameters
6. Save model, training metadata, and TensorBoard logs

- Rolling window backtests (see `eval/eval_rolling_backtest.py`)
- Stress tests: COVID crash, 2022 bear market
- Benchmarking: SPY (S&P 500 ETF), equal-weight portfolio
- Overfitting checks: compare in-sample vs. holdout Sharpe/returns, flag if holdout Sharpe < 0.5× in-sample or negative

#### 3.4.3 Suitability Checks

- Max drawdown, diversification, concentration, and suitability flags are computed for each window
- Results are summarized in `model_results_review.txt` and validation JSONs

### 3.5 User Interface and LLM Integration

#### 5.2 Stress Test Results

- All models experience significant drawdowns during COVID and 2022 bear market windows.
- Suitability flags fail in high-risk periods, indicating honest validation.
- No model is "too good to be true"; negative/low returns and high drawdowns are observed in some years.

#### 5.3 Portfolio Allocations

- Top-5 selection logic results in concentrated but diversified portfolios (see weights columns in CSVs).
- Allocations shift dynamically based on market regime and model profile.

#### 5.4 LLM-Generated Explanations

- Each result window includes a plain-language explanation (see `explanation` column in CSVs), e.g.:
  > "This AI strategy hasn't performed well recently, showing a slight loss overall and experiencing significant drops. It might not be suitable for short-term gains through speculation."
